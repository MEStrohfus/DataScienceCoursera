## This is a markdown file
I created this md file in GitHub because I've been unable to push from Git.
The error message I get is as follows:
 $ git push HelloWorld.md https://github.com/MEStrohfus/DataScienceCoursera.git/
 fatal: remote part of refspec is not a valid name in https://github.com/MEStrohfus/DataScienceCoursera.git/
Advice would be appreciated.
